## A/B test

There was one problem - in the evening, the delivery speed drops due to the fact that the couriers go home after the working day, and the number of orders only grows. This leads to the fact that at the time of the shift change, the delivery is very much reduced in efficiency.

data scientists have come up with a new algorithm that allows couriers to schedule their last orders before the end of the working day so that their delivery route matches the route home. That is, for couriers to deliver their last orders for the day, as if "on the way" home.

Together with the team, we decided to roll out an A / B test for two equal groups of couriers. Some couriers use the old algorithm without the "along the way" option, others see this option in their application and can select it.
